This is my workout page for math, in almost daily updating.

It used to be a section of my OneNote notes but I would like to share with the people when necessary, especially with Brady and Justina.

It took me some time to find a good platform to settle it down.

I need easy image-pasting so [typora](https://typora.io/) is used for typing the math contents and vscode is used for general editor. It's pity that vscode cannot preview all Latex contents.

[geogebra](https://www.geogebra.org/classic?lang=en) is used for all graph editing. Desktop version of Geogebra is also used since it has more keyboard shortcuts that web version in browser.

I tried to host this blog on GitLab with Hugo SSG but there was some path issue for CSS. I also tried on Wordpress.com. Wordpress is a good match with local [boostnote](https://boostnote.io/) editor but I have to purchase business plan to install Latex plugin on wordpress.com. I had to give it up.

Jekyll is old and huge with ruby installation but it is clear and easy to start with. Changing theme is not an easy task for Jekyll. I plan to switch to [jekyll-TeXt theme](https://github.com/kitian616/jekyll-TeXt-theme) in the future.

I follow the approach to append posts and keep home page fixed, and add anchors to all headers. It's a special way to make it some like Single-Page.

That's all about it so far.
