This is my workout page for math, in almost daily updating.

It used to be a section of my OneNote notes but I would like to share with the people when it needs, especially to Brady and Justina.

It took me some time to find a good platform to settle it down.

I need easily image-pasting so I use [typora](https://typora.io/) for drafting the math contents then use vscode the common editor for the rest of format cleaning. vscode cannot preview all Latex contents right now.

I use [geogebra](https://www.geogebra.org/classic?lang=en) for all graph editing. I will try using desktop version of it for more keyboard shortcuts.

I tried to host this blog on GitLab with Hugo SSG but there was some path issue for css. I also tried on Wordpress.com. It is good with local [boostnote](https://boostnote.io/) editing but it needs business plan to install Latex plugin. So I had to give it up.

Jekyll is old and huge with ruby installation but it is clear and easy to start. Changing theme is not an easy task for Jekyll. I plan to switch to jekyll-text theme in the close future.

I try to make each post to be single page with daily contents appended to it and with anchors for all headers.
